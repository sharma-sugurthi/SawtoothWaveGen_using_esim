# SawtoothWaveGen_using_esim
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and verification of Sawtooth and Triangular Wave Generators using eSim, an open-source EDA tool. The sawtooth wave, with its linear rise and sudden drop, is commonly used in oscilloscopes, switching power supplies, and waveform synthesis, while the triangular wave, featuring symmetric rise and fall.
